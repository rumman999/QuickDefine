# QuickDefine

QuickDefine is a simple utility that allows you to quickly search for the definition of selected text from any application.

### Features:
- **Hotkey**: Press **Alt + Space** to copy the highlighted text and search for its definition on Google.
- **Minimize to Tray**: The application can be minimized to the system tray for continuous background operation.
- **Close**: You can close the application anytime from the GUI.

### How to Use:
1. Download and install [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) if you plan to run the `.ahk` script.
2. You can also use the compiled `.exe` file which doesnâ€™t require AutoHotKey installation.
3. Press **Alt + Space** while any text is highlighted to automatically search for its definition on Google.

### Installation:
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. If using the `.ahk` script, ensure you have AutoHotKey installed.
3. Alternatively, just run the `QuickDefine.exe` file.
